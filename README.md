# Identifying Extreme Emission Line Galaxies (EELGs) from VLT MUSE observations

_Project Summary_: This project will use a sample of over 200 ESO Very Large Telescope observations using the integral field unit instrument MUSE of massive clusters of galaxies that very strongly distort the galaxies behind them to select a set of galaxies whose emission is dominated by narrow emission lines with very little stellar emission. These Extreme Emission Line Galaxies (EELGs) match the properties of many of the high redshift galaxies found by the JWST in the past 2 years. The project will involve the characterisation of the emission lines in these galaxies and compare them to other classes of galaxies.
