% Abstract of the paper
\begin{abstract}
JWST’s early release observations have now unveiled pristine epoch-of-reionization (EoR) galaxies. These galaxies, theorised to be the first observed actively driving ionization of the intergalactic medium, share striking spectral similarities with nearby extreme emission line galaxies (EELGs), with spectra dominated by narrow emission lines and very little stellar continuum; this population of galaxies is often referred to as the Green Peas. It has been shown that integral field spectroscopy can reveal EELGs in the lensing images of massive clusters, and this project aims to use a sample of over 200 VLT-MUSE observations to select a new sample of Green Peas to investigate. By characterising the emission lines in these galaxies and therefore inferring their properties, we draw analogues to the population of early-universe galaxies revealed by JWST; it follows that this analysis further assists characterisation of the universe at Cosmic Dawn, and demonstrates the candidates theorised to have driven the reionization of the IGM following the universe’s dark ages. This review outlines the key theory features of this project, illustrating key EoR theory, traditional and integral-field spectroscopy, and spectral analysis to determine the properties of galaxies.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% BODY OF PAPER %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\section{Introduction}

Modern near-field cosmology revolves around illuminating the characteristics of the universe at cosmic dawn; this era of the universe was dominated by pristine, low metallicity (popIII stars) and young (redshift $z>7$) galaxies with narrow spectral emission and very little stellar continuum \citep{klessen, zaroubi}. JWST, designed to unveil the universe when it was young, has now identified many massive galaxies at cosmic dawn, starting with the \cite{Rhoads} early-release observations of $z\sim8$ Pea-like galaxies, all the way out to the \cite{Naidu} $z=14.4$ galaxy, MoM-z14.

The work of \cite{Rhoads} identifies the first population of JWST epoch-of-reionization galaxies, thought to be some of the first observed candidates driving the reionization of the galactic medium after cosmic dawn, and this work demonstrates a comparison between these galaxies and nearby extreme emission line galaxies, also known as Green Peas. The work of \cite{jauzac} demonstrates that these peas can be identified from the radial images of massive galaxy clusters (in that case, the cluster MACSJ0417.5-1154), and this paper is designed to apply this methodology to a further 200 VLT-MUSE observations. In order to determine the metallicity of the spectra of these galaxies, we apply the novel direct $\mathrm{T}_E$ calibration method of \cite{jiang} of the O$_{II}$ to O$_{III}$ ratio R23. This investigation is designed to apply these novel methods to nearby Green Pea observations to further strengthen comparisons to EoR galaxies and further illustrate properties of galaxies at cosmic dawn. 

This review is designed to outline this project’s key theory. We begin in \textbf{Section~\ref{sec:cdawn}} by explaining Cosmic Dawn, the Epoch of Reionization, and the stellar and galactic formation theory underpinning the early evolution of galaxies; this provides necessary context behind the young galaxies identified by JWST. We then outline the theory behind the strong line emitter Green Peas, and their galaxy evolution and key features including contemporary work and lensing identification methods in \textbf{Section~\ref{sec:eelg}}. \textbf{Section~\ref{sec:spectro}} outlines the theory behind both traditional (that of JWST-NIRSpec) and integral field (that of VLT-MUSE) spectroscopy; \textbf{Section~\ref{sec:method}} then explores spectral techniques and line calibration to demonstrate metallicity inference techniques. We conclude (\textbf{Section~\ref{sec:conc}} ) by providing a brief methodology of the project and research outline.

\section{Cosmic Dawn and the Epoch of Reionisation}
\label{sec:cdawn}

\subsection{Cosmic Dawn: A brief history}
Following the temperature of the very young universe falling below 3000K, ions and electrons formed from the big bang $400\,$~kyr earlier (re)combined into primarily neutral hydrogen (H$_I$) and helium \citep{Barkana_2001}. At this point photons decoupled from baryons and the universe became transparent, releasing the cosmic microwave background relic signature and beginning the \textit{Dark Ages} at $z\sim1100$. This CMB contained an imprint of both the baryonic and dark matter density fluctuations within the plasma of the universe at this time \citep{smoot_1992}; the baryonic oscillations, damped by acoustic oscillations and diffusion, were much weaker than the dark matter fluctuations and led to the formation of virialized dark matter haloes, capturing baryons \citep{tacchella_2025,Tacchella_2018}. These baryons cooled within the haloes and formed molecular hydrogen and therefore the very first stars \citep{bromm_2004}.

These primordial stars ended the \textit{Dark Ages} at the point of \textit{Cosmic Dawn} around $z\sim30$ \citep{tacchella_2025}. The stars, formed from a neutral intergalactic medium (IGM), contained only primordial hydrogen and helium, free of any metals: these young stars are labelled PopIII and lack any current observational candidates, given the likely age of a PopIII star in the present universe \citep{klessen}. As these young galaxies began to emit ionizing radiation into the IGM, they began to create a patchwork of neutral and ionized (H$_II$) hydrogen, which eventually spread to a completely re-ionized universe; this era is therefore called the Epoch of Reionization \citep{Ciardi_2005, Morales_2010}. Current constraints place the EoR on $z\sim[6-15]$, with primordial indicators favouring a later onset \citep{planck_2016}. The EoR marks the watershed epoch at which the role of baryons becomes prominent in the structure and evolution of the universe; before this cosmic gas and plasma played a marginal role, and dark matter is believed to have dominated \citep{zaroubi}.
